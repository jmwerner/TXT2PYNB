This is a sigma $\sigma$ symbol in markdown and a forall $\forall$ symbol too!

Here's some mathematics $ 1 + 2 - 3 * 5 / 15$ and "quoted" information

And an integral for good measure $\int_{5}^{10}f(x)dx$

#Markdown header! 
'''


a = 5
b = 10
a + b

# BIG MARKDOWN HEADER!

Markdown line two, here's some math:  $\sigma+\alpha=\beta$
''' 
a=20
b=34
c=45

Indenting entire blocks is ok too, 
'''

b=35
c=41





# See, this block is indented and the for loop's appropriate indentations 
# are preserved too!
